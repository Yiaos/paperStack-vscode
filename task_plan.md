# Task Plan: 修复 OpenCode 进程重复启动（port=0 异常进程）
<!-- 
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
<!-- 
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
打开插件时仅启动单个 OpenCode 服务进程（固定端口策略/可复用策略），不再出现 `--port=0` 的多余进程。

## Current Phase
<!-- 
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 2

## Phases
<!-- 
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [x] Understand user intent
- [x] Identify constraints and requirements
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete
<!-- 
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [ ] Analyze upstream/opencode official implementation to learn expected server lifecycle
- [ ] Define technical approach to prevent duplicate server processes
- [ ] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!-- 
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
-->
- [ ] Implement minimal, low-intrusion fix in extension server lifecycle
- [ ] Keep changes localized to OpenCodeService/activation flow
- [ ] Add/adjust tests if needed (new feature → add tests)
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
<!-- 
  WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements.
  WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md.
-->
- [ ] Run `./bin/build-and-install.sh`
- [ ] Document test results in progress.md
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Final review and handoff to user.
  WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete.
-->
- [ ] Update README.md with behavior change
- [ ] Summarize changes, reasons, and possible side effects
- [ ] Deliver to user
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task.
  WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go.
  EXAMPLE: 
    1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage)
    2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file)
-->
1. 端口为 0 的进程是由哪个调用链触发的（扩展内/SDK/CLI）？
2. 上游 opencode web/官方实现如何管理 server 启动与复用？
3. 需要采用固定端口还是复用外部进程的策略？

## Decisions Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them.
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it.
  WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not |
    | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly |
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
<!-- 
  REMINDERS:
  - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
  - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
  - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
  - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead
